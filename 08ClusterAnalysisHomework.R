# Cluster Analysis
# Question #1: K-Means
# Read in the [08] Protein.txt dataset into your workspace. This dataset contains 
# protein consumption information from 1973 on nine different food groups across 
# 25 different European countries.
# 1. Use the following commands to read the data into your workspace appropriately 
# and scale the variables:

protein = read.table(file = "[08] Protein.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
protein.scaled = as.data.frame(scale(protein[, -1]))
rownames(protein.scaled) = protein$Country

# 2. Create and interpret a scree-plot for the within-cluster variance for various
# values of K used in the K-means algorithm.

withinss = numeric(24)
for (k in 1:24){
  set.seed(0)
  km.protein = kmeans(protein.scaled, centers = k)
  withinss[k] = sum(km.protein$withinss)
}

# a. Why might this graph indicate that K-means is not truly appropriate to model the data?
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(1:24, withinss, pch = 16, type = "b",
     xlab = "# Cluster",
     ylab = "Within-Cluster Variance",
     main = "Scree Plot for the K-Means Procedure")
# b/c the smallest within-cluster variance happens in 25 clusters, which is the observation numbers

# 3. Create and store 5 different K-means solutions that run the algorithm only 1 time each.
# (NB: Use set.seed(0) so your results will be reproducible.)
set.seed(0)
km.protein1 = kmeans(protein.scale, centers = 3) #Running the K-means procedure
km.protein2 = kmeans(protein.scale, centers = 3) #5 different times, but with
km.protein3 = kmeans(protein.scale, centers = 3) #only one convergence of the
km.protein4 = kmeans(protein.scale, centers = 3) #algorithm each time.
km.protein5 = kmeans(protein.scale, centers = 3)

# 4. Create and store 1 K-means solution that was selected from running the algorithm 
# 100 separate times. (N B: Use  set.seed(0) so your results will be reproducible.)
# 5. Plot the 6 different solutions from part 3 and 4 with:
#   a. Cereals on the x-axis.
#   b. RedMeat on the y-axis.
#   c. Colors for the different cluster assignments.
#   d. Labels for the total within-cluster variances.
# 6. Plot the solution from part 4 with: 
#   a. Cereals on the x-axis.
#   b. RedMeat on the y-axis.
#   c. A label for the total within-cluster variance.
#   d. Points for the centroids of each cluster.
#   e. A horizontal line at 0.
#   f. A vertical line at 0.
#   g. Text listing the country for each observation in your dataset
#     (instead of points), colored by the different cluster assignments.
#     Hint: Use type = “n” when creating the  plot(). Then, use the 
#     text() function in tandem with the rownames() function.
# 7. Interpret the clustering solution based on the graph you created in part 6.


# Question #2: Hierarchical Clustering
# Continue using the [08]Protein.txt dataset you already loaded into your workspace.
# 1. Calculate and store pairwise distances for each observation in the dataset.
# 2. Fit hierarchical clustering solutions using single, complete, and average linkage.
# 3. Visualize the dendrograms created in part 2.
#   a. Give an argument as to why single linkage might not be good to use.
#   b. Give an argument as to why complete linkage might be good to use.
# 4. Cut your complete linkage tree into 2 groups.
#   a. Visualize the solution overlaid on top of the dendrogram.
#   b. Interpret the clusters by aggregating across the median.
# 5. Cut your complete linkage tree into 5 groups.
#   a. Visualize the solution overlaid on top of the dendrogram.
#   b. Interpret the clusters by aggregating across the median
